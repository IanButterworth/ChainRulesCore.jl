The are broadly in agreement with the use of pullback and pushforward in differential geometry. But any geometer will tell you these are the super-boring flat cases. Some will also frown at you. They are also sometimes described in terms of the jacobian: The pushforward is jacobian vector product (jvp), and pullback is jacobian transpose vector product (j'vp). Other terms that may be used include for pullback the backpropagator, and by analogy for pushforward the forwardpropagator, thus these are the propagators. These are also good names because effectively they propagate wiggles and wobbles through them, via the chain rule. (the term backpropagator may originate with \"Lambda The Ultimate Backpropagator\" by Pearlmutter and Siskind, 2008)","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Core-Idea-1","page":"Introduction","title":"Core Idea","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#Less-formally-1","page":"Introduction","title":"Less formally","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The pushforward takes a wiggle in the input space, and tells what wobble you would create in the output space, by passing it through the function.\nThe pullback takes wobbliness information with respect to the function's output, and tells the equivalent wobbliness with respect to the functions input.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#More-formally-1","page":"Introduction","title":"More formally","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The pushforward of f takes the sensitivity of the input of f to a quantity, and gives the sensitivity of the output of f to that quantity The pullback of f takes the sensitivity of a quantity to the output of f, and gives the sensitivity of that quantity to the input of f.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Math-1","page":"Introduction","title":"Math","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"This is all a bit simplified by talking in 1D.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Lighter-Math-1","page":"Introduction","title":"Lighter Math","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"For a chain of expressions:","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"a = f(x)\nb = g(a)\nc = h(b)","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The pullback of g, which incorporates the knowledge of ∂b/∂a, applies the chain rule to go from ∂c/∂b to ∂c/∂a.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The pushforward of g,  which also incorporates the knowledge of ∂b/∂a, applies the chain rule to go from ∂a/∂x to ∂b/∂x.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Heavier-Math-1","page":"Introduction","title":"Heavier Math","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"If I have some functions: g(a), h(b) and f(x)=g(h(x)), and I know the pullback of g, at h(x) written: mathrmpullback_g(a)a=h(x), and I know the derivative of h with respect to its input b at g(x), written: leftdfrachbright_b=g(x) Then I can use the pullback to find: dfracfx:","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"dfracfx=mathrmmathrmpullback_g(a)a=h(x)left(leftdfrachbright_b=g(x)right)","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"If I know the derivative of g with respect to its input a at x, written: leftdfracgaright_a=x, and I know the pushforward of h at g(x) written: mathrmpushforward_h(b)b=g(x).
